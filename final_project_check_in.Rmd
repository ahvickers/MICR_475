## Accident Tracker Project Description

For our final project, we will be creating a tool that includes some basic analysis.

We are using the Integration-Manager Workflow described in the Git Pro book, where one of us has the main GitHub repository for the project. The other group members then all fork the project and push changes to their own fork. Once they have something they want added to the main project, they send a pull request to the main repository and it is merged with the main repository.

Our project will be a Shiny application that tracks US car accidents in 2019 onto an interactive map. It will include a shiny application, an R package with documented functions, a vignette for the package, and unit tests for the package.
