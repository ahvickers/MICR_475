Homework 1
================

Using **R Markdown notebooks** allows you to have a record of your code,
the results, and comments all in one place to make it easier for you and
others reading it later to understand *what* you did and *why*.

You can add text, then embed the code in the notebook in chunks. It will
then run the code and include the result.

``` r
